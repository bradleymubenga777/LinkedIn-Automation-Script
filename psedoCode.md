Make sure you test each step you make.

//1. Store all components that you will be using in individual variables (e.g the button, text input, name of the prospect)

//2. Initilize a for loop that runs as long as the total number of buttons is less than 50 [ for (buttonName.length < 50) {} ]

//3. Start the application process by doing the following:
    - Add a click function to the 'connect' button.
    - Fill the text input of the popup with the string template and assign the name of the user to the user's name variable that you stored earlier [e.g `{nameVariable}` ]
    - Check if the input was set successfuly and then...
    - Add a click function to the 'conncet' button that sends the invite.
